How it works:

1. Users will be able to enter the lottery using ETH whose price will be based on USD - > 50$
2. An administrator decides when the lottery ends (Upgrade with DAO and Chainlink Keepers)
3. The lottery selects a winner randomly

To connect to mainnet-fork-dev an Alchemi API key has been used

Testing:

1. 'mainnet-fork'.
2. 'development' with Mocks.
3. 'testnet'
